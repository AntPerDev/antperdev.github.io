Hi!
My name is Antonio.

In recent years I have done various training related to web development. The last three years I have completed the higher degree training cycle in web development (Ciclo Formación Grado Superior en Desarrollo Web). In which I have acquired programming skills in:

- POO
- Java
- Sql

Other technologies such as:

- Html
- Css
- Javascript
- Php

And markup languages ​​such as:

- XML,
- XML definition with DTD 
- transformations with XSLT

Servers and a lot of other technologies like Apache or Bind. I have been completing my training on online platforms such as Openwebinars ( Python, Django, DjangoRestFramework) and Udemy ( Js, Angular). Thanks to which I have advanced in my knowledge.

I still have a lot to learn and I would like to do it in a real environment, programming integrated in a development team.

Thanks for read me.
